        "Certainly! Here are the answers to your theoretical questions, clearly numbered and aligned:\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?**  \n",
        "   - **Interpreted languages** execute code line-by-line at runtime (e.g., Python), whereas **compiled languages** translate the whole code into machine code before execution (e.g., C, C++).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **What is exception handling in Python?**  \n",
        "   - Exception handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks to prevent the program from crashing.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?**  \n",
        "   - The `finally` block contains code that always executes, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not, typically used for cleanup actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **What is logging in Python?**  \n",
        "   - Logging is the process of recording messages, errors, or informational events to a file or console for tracking the programâ€™s execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **What is the significance of the del method in Python?**  \n",
        "   - The `__del__` method is a destructor, called when an object is about to be destroyed, useful for cleanup actions like closing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?**  \n",
        "   - `import module` imports the whole module, accessed with module name prefix; `from module import name` imports specific functions/classes directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?**  \n",
        "   - By specifying multiple exceptions in a single `except` block using a tuple, e.g., `except (TypeError, ValueError):`.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?**  \n",
        "   - The `with` statement ensures automatic file closing after its block execution, even if exceptions occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?**  \n",
        "   - Multithreading runs multiple threads within one process sharing memory; multiprocessing runs multiple processes with separate memory spaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **What are the advantages of using logging in a program?**  \n",
        "    - Helps with debugging, monitoring, audit trails, and diagnosing errors without interrupting the program flow.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. **What is memory management in Python?**  \n",
        "    - Memory management involves allocating and deallocating memory to objects automatically to optimize resource use.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. **What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?**  \n",
        "    1. Write `try` block with code that might fail.  \n",
        "    2. Handle errors in `except` block(s).  \n",
        "    3. Optionally include `else` block if no exceptions occur.  \n",
        "    4. Optionally include `finally` block for cleanup.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. **Why is memory management important in Python?**  \n",
        "    - Prevents memory leaks and optimizes performance by efficiently using system memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. **What is the role of try and except in exception handling?**  \n",
        "    - `try` contains code that may raise exceptions; `except` handles those exceptions to avoid crashes.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. **How does Python's garbage collection system work?**  \n",
        "    - It automatically reclaims memory by detecting objects no longer referenced and frees their memory, primarily using reference counting and cyclic garbage collector.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. **What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?**  \n",
        "    - The `else` block runs if no exceptions were raised in the `try` block, useful for code that should run only when everything goes well.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. **What are the common logging levels in Python?**  \n",
        "    - `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. **What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?**  \n",
        "    - `os.fork()` creates a child process as a copy of the parent in Unix-based systems; `multiprocessing` provides a platform-independent API for creating processes with additional features.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. **What is the importance of closing a file in Python?**  \n",
        "    - Closing a file releases system resources and ensures all buffered data is written to disk.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. **What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?**  \n",
        "    - `file.read()` reads the entire file or specified number of bytes; `file.readline()` reads one line at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. **What is the logging module in Python used for?**  \n",
        "    - To provide a flexible framework for emitting log messages from Python programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. **What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?**  \n",
        "    - Provides functions to interact with the operating system, such as file and directory manipulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. **What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?**  \n",
        "    - Managing circular references, overhead of automatic memory management, and potential fragmentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. **How do you raise an exception manually in Python?**  \n",
        "    - By using the `raise` statement, e.g., `raise ValueError(\"Invalid input\")`.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. **Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?**  \n",
        "    - It allows concurrent execution, improving performance especially in I/O-bound or high-latency tasks.\n",

        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?   \n",
        "OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which contain data and methods to manipulate that data. It focuses on using reusable code structures called classes and objects to model real-world entities.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?  \n",
        "A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?    \n",
        "An object is an instance of a class. It represents an individual entity with specific attribute values and behavior as defined by the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?    \n",
        "Abstraction hides complex implementation details and shows only the essential features.\n",
        "Encapsulation restricts access to certain components of an object and protects data by making it private and accessible only through specific methods.\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?   \n",
        "Dunder methods (double underscore methods) are special methods in Python with names like __init__, __str__, __repr__ that allow user-defined classes to emulate built-in types or behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.   \n",
        "Inheritance allows one class (child/subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent/superclass), facilitating code reuse and hierarchy.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?   \n",
        "Polymorphism allows methods to have different behaviors in different classes, typically by method overriding, enabling the same interface to represent different underlying forms.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?   \n",
        "Encapsulation is achieved by making variables private using name mangling (prefixing with double underscores), and providing getter/setter methods to control access.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?   \n",
        "A constructor is a special method __init__() that initializes an object's attributes when it is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?    \n",
        "Class methods are methods that take the class itself (cls) as the first argument, marked with @classmethod.\n",
        "Static methods do not take an automatic first argument (neither self nor cls), marked with @staticmethod.\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?   \n",
        "Python does not support traditional method overloading directly. Method overloading means having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?   \n",
        "Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?   \n",
        "@property allows a method to be accessed like an attribute, often used to implement getter, setter, and deleter methods for encapsulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?   \n",
        "Polymorphism enables flexibility and reusability by allowing the same interface to work with objects of different types or classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?    \n",
        "An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and usually contains one or more abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses. Typically done using the abc module.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?   \n",
        "Reusability through inheritance\n",
        "Modularity and encapsulation for better code management\n",
        "Easier maintenance and modification\n",
        "Real-world modeling\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?   \n",
        "Class variables are shared by all instances of a class.\n",
        "Instance variables are unique to each object created from the class.\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?   \n",
        "Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one base class.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of \"str\" and \"repr\" methods in Python.    \n",
        "__str__() returns a user-friendly string representation of an object.\n",
        "__repr__() returns an official string representation, ideally one that can recreate the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the 'super()' function in Python?   \n",
        "super() allows a subclass to call a method from its parent class, often used to extend or modify inherited behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the del method in Python?     \n",
        "The __del__() method is a destructor that is called when an object is about to be destroyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?    \n",
        "@staticmethod does not access class or instance attributes, acts like a normal function inside class namespace.\n",
        "@classmethod takes the class itself as the first argument and can modify class state.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?    \n",
        "Subclass can override a method of the superclass, and when calling that method via a superclass reference, the subclass's implementation is executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?    \n",
        "Method chaining is the ability to call multiple methods sequentially on the same object in a single line, usually by having methods return self.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the call method in Python?   \n",
        "__call__() makes an instance callable like a function"
